# Project Alice?
This project was created as my Capstone for Humber College. The purpose of this was to demonstrate our abilities in designing

#### Abstract
What would you do if you were trapped in a dream? If the world had turned against you, and escape was no where in sight? 
An amnesiac given the name "Alice" seems to have found herself in such a predicament. The only thing she is certain of is her 
ability to take the shapes of other creatures and make use of their skill sets.
